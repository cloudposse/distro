output format (#2497, Albert Krewinkel).\r\n\r\n - Add `tex_math_dollars` to `multimarkdownExtensions` (#5512). This form is now supported in multimarkdown, in addition to `tex_math_double_backslash`.\r\n\r\n - Fix `--self-contained` so it works when output format has extensions. Previously if you used `--self-contained` with `html-smart` or `html+smart`, it wouldn’t work.\r\n\r\n - Add template variable `curdir` with working directory from which pandoc is run (#5464).\r\n\r\n - Markdown reader: don’t create implicit reference for empty header (#5549).\r\n\r\n - Muse reader: allow images inside link descriptions (Alexander Krotov).\r\n\r\n - HTML reader: epub related fixes.\r\n \r\n - With epub extensions, check for `epub:type` in addition to `type`.\r\n - Fix problem with noteref parsing which caused block-level content to be eaten with the noteref.\r\n - Rename `pAnyTag` to `pAny`.\r\n - Refactor note resolution.\r\n - Trim definition list terms (Alexander Krotov).\r\n\r\n - LaTeX reader:\r\n \r\n - Add braces when resolving `\\DeclareMathOperator` (#5441). These seem to be needed for xelatex but not pdflatex.\r\n - Allow newlines in `\\mintinline`.\r\n - Pass through unknown listings language as class (#5540). Previously if the language was not in the list of languages supported by listings, it would not be added as a class, so highlighting would not be triggered.\r\n - `rawLaTeXInline`: Include trailing `{}`s in raw latex commands (#5439). This change affects the markdown reader and other readers that allow raw LaTeX. Previously, trailing `{}` would be included for unknown commands, but not for known commands. However, they are sometimes used to avoid a trailing space after the command. The chances that a `{}` after a LaTeX command is not part of the command are very small.\r\n\r\n - MediaWiki reader: handle multiple attributes in table row (#5471, chinapedia).\r\n\r\n - Docx reader: Add support for `w:rtl` (#5545). Elements with this property are put into Span inlines with `dir=\"rtl\"`.\r\n\r\n - DocBook reader: Issue `IgnoredElement` warnings.\r\n\r\n - Org reader (Albert Krewinkel):\r\n \r\n - Fix planning elements in headers level 3 and higher (#5494). Planning info is now always placed before the subtree contents. Previously, the planning info was placed after the content if the header’s subtree was converted to a list, which happens with headers of level 3 and higher per default.\r\n - Omit, but warn about unknown export options. Unknown export options are properly ignored and omitted from the output.\r\n - Prefer plain symbols over math symbols (#5483). Symbols like `\\alpha` are output plain and unemphasized, not as math.\r\n - Recognize emphasis after TODO/DONE keyword (#5484).\r\n\r\n - FB2 reader:\r\n \r\n - Skip unknown elements rather than throwing errors (#5560). Sometimes custom elements are used (e.g. `id` element inside `author`); previously the reader would halt with an error. Now it skips the element and issues an `IgnoredElement` warning.\r\n - Parse notes (#5493, Alexander Krotov).\r\n - Internal improvements (Alexander Krotov).\r\n\r\n - OpenDocument writer: Roll back automatic figure/table numbering (#5474). This was added in pandoc 2.7.2, but it makes it impossible to use pandoc-crossref. So this has been rolled back for now, until we find a good solution to make this behavior optional (or a creative way to let pandoc-crossref and this feature to coexist).\r\n\r\n - New module Text.Pandoc.Writers.Jira, exporting `writeJira` \\[API change\\] (Albert Krewinkel).\r\n\r\n - EPUB writer:\r\n \r\n - Don’t include ‘landmarks’ if there aren’t any. Previously we could get an empty ol element, which caused validation errors with epubcheck.\r\n - Ensure unique ids for styleesheets in content.opf (#5463).\r\n - Make stylesheet link compatible with kindlegen (#5466, Eric Schrijver). Pandoc omitted `type=\"text/css\"` from both `<style>` and `<rel=\"stylesheet\">` elements in all templates, which is valid according to the spec. However, Amazon’s kindlegen software relies on this attribute on `<link>` elements when detecting stylesheets to include.\r\n\r\n - HTML writer:\r\n \r\n - Output video and audio elements depending on file extension of the image path (Mauro Bieg).\r\n - Emit empty alt tag in figures (#5518, Mauro Bieg). The same text is already in the\r\n <figcaption>\r\n and screen-readers would read it twice, see #4737.\r\n - Don’t add variation selector if it’s already there. This fixes round-trip failures.\r\n - Prevent gratuitious emojification on iOS (#5469). iOS chooses to render a number of Unicode entities, including ‘↩’, as big colorful emoji. This can be defeated by appending Unicode VARIATION SELECTOR-15’/‘VARIATION SELECTOR-16’. So we now append this character when escaping strings, for both ‘↩’ and ‘↔’. If other characters prove problematic, they can simply be added to `needsVariationSelector`.\r\n - Add `class=\"heading\"` to level 7+ Headers rendered as `<p>` elements (#5457).\r\n\r\n - RST writer: treat Span with no attributes as transparent (#5446). Previously an Emph inside a Span was being treated as nested markup and ignored. With this patch, the Span is just ignored.\r\n\r\n - LaTeX writer:\r\n \r\n - Include inline code attributes with `--listings` (#5420).\r\n - Don’t produce columns environment unless beamer (#5485).\r\n - Fix footnote in image caption. Regression: the fix for #4683 broke this case.\r\n - Don’t highlight code in headings (#5574). This causes compilation errors.\r\n - Use `\\mbox` to get proper behavior inside `\\sout` (#5529).\r\n\r\n - EPUB writer: Fix document section assignments (#5546). For example, introduction should go in bodymatter, not frontmatter, and epigraph, conclusion, and afterward should go in bodymatter, not backmatter. For the full list of assignments, see the manual.\r\n\r\n - Markdown writer:\r\n \r\n - Add backslashes to avoid unwanted interpretation of definition list terms as other kinds of block (#554).\r\n - Ensure the code fence is long enough (#5519). Previously too few backticks were used when the code block contained an indented line of backticks. (Ditto tildes.)\r\n - Handle labels with integer names (Jesse Rosenthal, #5495). Previously if labels had integer names, it could produce a conflict with auto-labeled reference links. Now we test for a conflict and find the next available integer. This involves adding a new state variable `stPrevRefs` to keep track of refs used in other document parts when using `--reference-location=block|section`\r\n\r\n - Textile writer: fix closing tag for math output (Albert Krewinkel). Opening and closing tag for math output match now.\r\n\r\n - Org writer: always indent src blocks content by 2 spaces (#5440, Albert Krewinkel). Emacs always uses two spaces when indenting the content of src blocks, e.g., when exiting a `C-c '` edit-buffer. Pandoc used to indent contents by the space-equivalent of one tab, but now always uses two spaces, too.\r\n\r\n - Asciidoc writer:\r\n \r\n - Use `` `+...+` `` form for inline code. The old `` `a__b__c` `` yields emphasis inside code in asciidoc. To get a pure literal code span, use `` `+a__b__c+` ``.\r\n - Use proper smart quotes with asciidoctor (#5487). Asciidoctor has a different format for smart quotes.\r\n - Use doubled ## when necessary for spans (#5566).\r\n - Ensure correct nesting of strong/emph (#5565): strong must be the outer element.\r\n\r\n - JATS writer:\r\n \r\n - Wrap elements with p when needed (#5570). The JATS spec restricts what elements can go inside `fn` and `list-item`. So we wrap other elements inside `<p specific-use=\"wrapper\">` when needed.\r\n - Properly handle footnotes (#5511) according to “best practice.” (Group them at the end in `<fn-group>` and use `<xref>` elements to link them.)\r\n - Fix citations with PMID so they validate (#5481). This includes an update to data/jats.csl.\r\n - Ensure validity of `<pub-date>` by parsing the date and extracting year, month, and day, as expected. Also add an iso-8601-date attribute automatically.\r\n - Don’t use `<break>` element for LineBreak. It is only allowed in a few special contexts, and not in `<p>` elements.\r\n - Don’t make `<string-name>` a child of `<string>`, which is illegal.\r\n\r\n - FB2 writer:\r\n \r\n - Do not wrap note references into `<sup>` and brackets (Alexander Krotov). Existing FB2 readers, such as FBReader, already display links with type=“note” as a superscript.\r\n - Use genre metadata field (#5478).\r\n\r\n - Muse writer: do not escape empty line after `<br>` (Alexander Krotov).\r\n\r\n - Add unicode code point in “Missing character” warning (#5538). If the character isn’t in the console font, the message is pretty useless, so we show the code point for anything non-ASCII.\r\n\r\n - Lua: add Version type to simplify comparisons (Albert Krewinkel). Version specifiers like `PANDOC_VERSION` and `PANDOC_API_VERSION` are turned into `Version` objects. The objects simplify version-appropriate comparisons while maintaining backward-compatibility. A function `pandoc.types.Version` is added as part of the newly introduced module `pandoc.types`, allowing users to create version objects in scripts.\r\n\r\n - pandoc lua module (Albert Krewinkel):\r\n \r\n - Fix deletion of nonexistent attributes (#5569).\r\n - Better tests for Attr and AttributeList.\r\n\r\n - pandoc.mediabag lua module (Albert Krewinkel):\r\n \r\n - Add function `delete` for deleting a single item.\r\n - Add function `empty` for removing all entries.\r\n - Add function `items` for iterating over mediabag.\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.Class: Fix handling of `file:` URL scheme in `downloadOrRead` (#5517, Mauro Bieg). Previously `file:/` URLs were handled wrongly and pandoc attempted to make HTTP requests, which failed.\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.MIME: add `mediaCategory` \\[API change\\] (Mauro Bieg).\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.Shared:\r\n \r\n - Add `onlySimpleTableCells` \\[API change\\] (Mauro Bieg) and use this to consolidate simple-table detection (#5524). This fixes an inconsistency in the HTML reader, which did not treat tables with `<p>` inside cells as simple.\r\n - `metaToJSON`: treat digits starting with 0 as a string, not a number (#5479). This fixes a regression in YAML metadata in pandoc 2.7.2.\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.Logging: Add `IgnoredElement` constructor for `LogMessage`. `SkippedConetnt` doesn’t work for some XML-based readers which don’t have access to parsec source positions.\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.Asciify: Add Turkish undotted-i (#5433, Mauro Bieg).\r\n\r\n - Improve output of Lua tests (#5499, Albert Krewinkel). This makes use of tasty-lua, a package to write tests in Lua and integrate the results into Tasty output. Test output becomes more informative: individual tests and test groups become visible in test output. Failures are reported with helpful error messages.\r\n\r\n - Lua: add `pandoc.system` module (#5468, Albert Krewinkel). The `system` Lua module provides utility functions to interact with the operating- and file system. E.g. `print(pandoc.system.get_current_directory())` or\r\n \r\n ``` lua\r\n pandoc.system.with_temporary_directory('tikz', function (dir)\r\n -- write and compile a TikZ file with pdflatex\r\n end)\r\n ```\r\n\r\n - LaTeX template: Add pdflang to hypersetup if lang is set (#5443).\r\n\r\n - beamer template: Fix using Beamer with geometry (#5505, Daniel Maslowski). Beamer already loads geometry, so we need to use the `\\geometry` command to set geometry options.\r\n\r\n - EPUB2/3 templates: Move inline styles to default epub.css (#5466). NOTE: Those who use a custom CSS stylesheet with EPUB should add these lines:\r\n \r\n code{ white-space: pre-wrap; }\r\n span.smallcaps{ font-variant: small-caps; }\r\n span.underline{ text-decoration: underline; }\r\n q { quotes: \"“\" \"”\" \"‘\" \"’\"; }\r\n div.column{ display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; width: 50%; }\r\n\r\n - reveal.js template:\r\n \r\n - Updates for revealjs 3.8.0 (#5435, ebiim).\r\n - Remove reference to head.min.js (#5448, Winnie Hellmann). NOTE: users will need to update reveal.js to at least 3.8.0 for their presentations generated with this version of pandoc to work correctly.\r\n\r\n - Text.Pandoc.PDF:\r\n \r\n - Replace `</>` with literal `/` (#5451). We use forward-slash for a directory separator in tmpDir, even on Windows (because that’s what tex likes). So we should not put a backslash between the tmpDir and the filename on Windows. This is harmless enough in normal Windows setups, but it breaks on Cygwin. Thanks to @cc2x for noticing and diagnosing the problem.\r\n - Allow use of `-output-directory` in `--pdf-engine-opt` (#5462). This is currently possible with `mklatex` and `-outdir`, but was not yet possible with xelatex and `-output-directory`.\r\n - For PDF via ms/pdfroff, make TOC appear at beginning and in PDF bookmarks (#5553). Previously the TOC appeared at the end of the document, and was not bookmarked. To keep it at the end, add `--pdf-engine-opt=--no-toc-relocation` to your command line.\r\n\r\n - Fix broken links in documents (#5473, Shim Myeongseob). Also, use absolute links to pandoc.org when possible, so that the links can be followed by people viewing these documents on GitHub.\r\n\r\n - Improved sample lua tikz filter in lua-filters docs (#5445, Matthew Doty). There are three changes:\r\n \r\n - It only processes elements which begin with `\\begin{tikzpicture}`\r\n - It uses pdf2svg instead of imagemagick to preserve fidelity\r\n - The images produced have transparent backgrounds\r\n\r\n - MANUAL.txt:\r\n \r\n - Add note about `title-meta`, `author-meta`, `date-meta` (#5486).\r\n - Fix typo (#5489, Christian Krause).\r\n\r\n - add test/tables.xwiki to git and pandoc.cabal (#5498, Mauro Bieg).\r\n\r\n - Disable missing-home-modules warning in `stack.yaml`. Otherwise `stack ghci` fails.\r\n" }
