If you see an error like \"Invalid expression for var.example\" on local-only commands after upgrading, ensure that the remotely-stored value for the given variable uses correct HCL value syntax.\r\n \r\n This _does not_ affect true remote operations like `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`, because the processing of variables for those always happens in the remote system.\r\n\r\nBUG FIXES:\r\n\r\n* config: Fix regression where self wasn't properly evaluated when using for_each ([#23215](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23215))\r\n* config: dotfiles are no longer excluded when copying existing modules; previously, any dotfile/dir was excluded in this copy, but this change makes the local copy behavior match go-getter behavior ([#22946](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22946))\r\n* core: Ensure create_before_destroy ordering is enforced with dependencies between modules ([#22937](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22937))\r\n* core: Fix some destroy-time cycles due to unnecessary edges in the graph, and remove unused resource nodes ([#22976](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/22976))\r\n* backend/remote: Correctly handle remotely-stored variables that are marked as \"HCL\" when running local-only operations like `terraform import`. Previously they would produce a type mismatch error, due to misinterpreting them as literal strings. ([#23229](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23229))" }
