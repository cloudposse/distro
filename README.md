# Distro [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/distro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/distro)

Cloud Posse distribution of native apps.

Use this repo to easily install binary releases of popular apps. This is useful for inclusion into a `Dockerfile` to install dependencies.

## Usage

See all available packages:
```
make -C install help
```

Install everything...
```
make -C install all
```

Install specific packages:
```
make -C install aws-vault chamber
```

Install to a specific folder:
```
make -C install aws-vault INSTALL_PATH=/usr/bin
```

Add this to a `Dockerfile` to easily install packages:
```
RUN git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/cloudposse/distro.git /distro && \
    rm -rf /distro/.git && \
    make -C /distro/install kubectl
```

Uninstall to a specific package
```
make -C uninstall yq
```

## Makefile Inclusion

Sometimes it's necessary to install some binary dependencies when building projects. For example, we frequently 
rely on `gomplate` or `helm` to build chart packages.

Here's a stub you can include into a `Makefile` to make it easier to install binary dependencies.

```
export DISTRO_VERSION ?= master
export DISTRO_PATH ?= distro/
export INSTALL_PATH ?= $(DISTRO_PATH)/vendor

## Install distro
distro/install:
        @if [ ! -d $(DISTRO_PATH) ]; then \
          echo "Installing distro $(DISTRO_VERSION)..."; \
          rm -rf $(DISTRO_PATH); \
          git clone --depth=1 -b $(DISTRO_VERSION) git@github.com:cloudposse/distro.git $(DISTRO_PATH); \
          rm -rf $(DISTRO_PATH)/.git; \
        fi

## Install package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
distro/install/%: distro/install
        @make -C $(DISTRO_PATH)/install $(subst distro/install/,,$@)

## Uninstall package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
distro/uninstall/%:
        @make -C $(DISTRO_PATH)/uninstall $(subst distro/uninstall/,,$@)
```
