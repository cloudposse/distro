  Cloud Posse distribution of awesome apps.

introduction: |-

  Use this repo to easily install releases of popular Open Source apps. We provide a few ways to use it.
  
  1. `Makefile` based installer which downloads packages directly from their source and installs them
  2. Alpine Linux package repository (`apk.cloudposse.com`) which installs prebuilt packages using original source binary (where possible)
  3. Docker image (`cloudposse/packages`) which distributes an image with all linux binaries for `x86_64`

  See examples below for usage.

usage: |-

  ### Alpine Repository (recommended)
  
  Configure the alpine repository

  ```
  curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sudo bash
  ```

  Simply install any package as normal:
  ```
  apk add gomplate
  ```

  You can use version pinning:
  ```
  apk add gomplate==3.0.0
  ```

  And even repository pinning:
  ```
  apk add gomplate@cloudposse==3.0.0
  ```

  ### Makefile Interface
  
  The `Makefile` interface works on OSX and Linux. It's a great way to distribute binaries in a OS-agnostic way which does not depend on a package manager.

  See all available packages:
  ```
  make -C install help
  ```

  Install everything...
  ```
  make -C install all
  ```

  Install specific packages:
  ```
  make -C install aws-vault chamber
  ```

  Install to a specific folder:
  ```
  make -C install aws-vault INSTALL_PATH=/usr/bin
  ```

  Uninstall a specific package
  ```
  make -C uninstall yq
  ```

examples: |-
  ### Docker Multi-stage Build

  Add this to a `Dockerfile` to install packages using a multi-stage build process:
  ```
  FROM cloudposse/packages:latest AS packages

  COPY --from=packages /packages/bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/
  ```

  ### Docker with Git Clone
  
  Or... add this to a `Dockerfile` to easily install packages on-demand:
  ```
  RUN git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git /packages && \
      rm -rf /packages/.git && \
      make -C /packages/install kubectl
  ```

  ### Makefile Inclusion

  Sometimes it's necessary to install some binary dependencies when building projects. For example, we frequently 
  rely on `gomplate` or `helm` to build chart packages.

  Here's a stub you can include into a `Makefile` to make it easier to install binary dependencies.

  ```
  export PACKAGES_VERSION ?= master
  export PACKAGES_PATH ?= packages/
  export INSTALL_PATH ?= $(PACKAGES_PATH)/vendor

  ## Install packages
  packages/install:
          @if [ ! -d $(PACKAGES_PATH) ]; then \
            echo "Installing packages $(PACKAGES_VERSION)..."; \
            rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
            git clone --depth=1 -b $(PACKAGES_VERSION) https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
            rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH)/.git; \
          fi

  ## Install package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
  packages/install/%: packages/install
          @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/install $(subst packages/install/,,$@)

  ## Uninstall package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
  packages/uninstall/%:
          @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/uninstall $(subst packages/uninstall/,,$@)
  ```
